                    <p>
                        Nigerian youths exist in a society that has abundant but untapped and underutilized human and natural resources. This reality sometimes inhibits and discourages such young people from reaching their potentials. 
                        Research however shows that with right mentorship, people in disadvantaged communities/positions can harness and develop their resources. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Similarly, young Nigerians â€“ especially those in disadvantaged communities are vulnerable to social vices. They are faced with challenges of fending for themselves, charting a course to lead their lives without the help of a guide or mentor to curtail their excesses. 
                        This puts them at a disadvantage to peers from privileged backgrounds. Although some of the youths are not in these categories, they tend to experience difficulty in igniting their inner man and identifying their passion and path for their future. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, this program was born out of the need to see young people equipped and mentored for a successful professional and academic life. The project will lead youths down the path of significant growth and development. We believe that youth are our future leaders, 
                        and we want to make sure they are ready to play their roles in their chosen paths actively. With our mentorship programs, participants learn the skills they need to adapt to this generation and lead the next.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">WHY MENTORING</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mentoring provides young people with guidance and confidence needed to ensure strong footholds in their careers. It gives them assurance needed to surmount day-to-day challenges and that they matter. 
                        Research affirms that quality mentoring relationships powerfully influence young people in a variety of personal, academic, and professional situations positively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mentoring shapes a young person to be positioned for social and economic opportunities. It aids personal growth and development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roles played by mentors cannot be overemphasised. It makes a remarkable difference in the lives of youths.  By acting as advisors, role models, and confidants to the students, mentors maximize their personal, academic and professional experiences. 
                        They get an opportunity to contribute values to their communities.

                            <p>In the first phase of this project, 50 participants will be paired with 50 mentors for a period of 9months. 
                                Subsequently, we aim to reach a more significant number of youths, assist them in shaping their professional, academic and entrepreneurial goals. 
                                Youths who have mentors have a better advantage at professional and personal development.
