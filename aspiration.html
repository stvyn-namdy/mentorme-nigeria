                    <p>
                        The potentials of Nigerian youths are perhaps conflicting: on one side, a diamond mine and, on the other hand, a largely untapped resource, and possibly never gets tapped. 
                        With growing evidence, research has shown that the untapped resource could be harnessed and developed when they are mentored/inspired by the right people. They go on to become change agents, growing and thriving. 
                        Thus, bringing about positive changes.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In our society, young people are some of the most vulnerable. At a young age, a chunk of them is exposed to several vices and not praiseworthy practices. 
                        They are faced with challenges of fending for themselves, charting a course to lead their lives without the help of a guide or mentor to curtail their excesses. 
                        Although some of the youths are not in these categories, they tend to experience difficulty in igniting their inner man and identifying their passion and path for their future. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This program was birthed because of the need to have young people equipped and mentored. To assist in charting their career path and open them to different opportunities. 
                        The project will lead youths down the path of significant growth and development. We believe that youth are our future leaders, and we want to make sure they are ready to play their roles in their chosen paths actively. 
                        With our mentorship programs, participants learn the skills they need to adapt to this generation and lead the next.

                    <h3 class="text-center">WHY MENTORING</h3>
                    <p>
                        Why Mentoring? Mentoring essentially provides young people with guidance and confidence to have strong footholds in their chosen careers. It gives them assurance needed to surmount day-to-day challenges and that they matter. 
                        Research affirms that quality mentoring relationships powerfully influence young people in a variety of personal, academic, and professional situations positively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mentoring shapes a young person to be positioned for social and economic opportunity, and it aids personal growth and development. However, one in every three young persons will grow up without this critical asset. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roles played by mentors cannot be overemphasised. It makes a remarkable difference in the lives of youths. By acting as advisors, role models, and confidants to the students, helps them maximise their personal, 
                        academic and professional experiences and Identify how valuable they can be to their communities.

                            <p>In the first phase of this project, 50 participants will be paired with 50 mentors for a period of 9months. 
                                Subsequently, we aim to reach a more significant number of youths, assist them in shaping their professional, academic and entrepreneurial goals. 
                                Youths who have mentors have a better advantage at professional and personal development.
